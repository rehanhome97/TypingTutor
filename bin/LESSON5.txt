The younger boy stuck his thumb in his mouth; it was something he hadn't done for two years. When he realized what he was doing, he pulled his thumb out and thrust his hands in his pants pockets. The older one grabbed him by the shirt and tugged him up the hillside.
The first cop on the scene was a patrolman riding single in his squad. He stepped close enough to see the blood, leaned forward to feel the cold neck and backed away. If there was evidence around the body, he didn't want to destroy it.
Two Homicide cops arrived fifteen minutes later, but nobody had yet recognized Hart.
"Throat cut," one cop said. "Could be a Crow hit. That'd be bad. Look at his clothes—decent clothes, the guy's got some bread."
The second cop, the same bespectacled investigator who'd caught the Benton murderer, eased Hart's billfold out of his hip pocket, stood up, opened it and looked at the driver's license behind the plastic window.
"Sweet bleedin' Jesus," he said aloud, his face suddenly ashen.
